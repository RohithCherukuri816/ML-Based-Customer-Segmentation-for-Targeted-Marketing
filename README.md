## **Overview**

The goal of this project is to apply **unsupervised learning** to segment customers based on key features, which can be used for targeted marketing, product recommendations, and customer retention strategies. The project employs the **K-Means clustering algorithm** for customer segmentation, followed by model evaluation and a real-time recommendation system.
